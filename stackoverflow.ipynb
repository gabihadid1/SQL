    "### Using BigQuery for Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will utilize Google Cloud's BigQuery service for data analysis. Instructions on working with BigQuery were provided in the lesson and video tutorial *BigQuery: Cloud Data Warehouse*. Additional information can be found [here](link).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Things to Note:\n",
    "- BigQuery service provides access to data at a large scale, up to petabytes, using SQL commands.\n",
    "- Your usage with the free access is limited per month. Be mindful when executing queries, especially those not limited to SELECT queries. Avoid using the `*` command, instead select appropriate columns. You can see the size of data processed for each query after writing it, but before running it.\n",
    "- In this exercise, we'll use the Stack Overflow database with the name `stackoverflow`. Stack Overflow is a highly useful online community for developers and code users who ask and answer questions about coding challenges they encounter.\n",
    "- The `stackoverflow` database contains tables:\n",
    "  - `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`\n",
    "  - `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`\n",
    "  - `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`\n",
    "- When referring to tables in BigQuery, use backticks around the table name (this is not necessary in regular SQL).\n",
    "- For each question, print both the query performed and the received output in JSON format.\n",
    "- If an additional question is asked (besides the query and its output), provide the answer in free text below the query output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.\n",
    "We want to find the top posts related to questions about the JavaScript language. Write a query that retrieves all posts containing the tag \"javascript\", regardless of case. Return the `id`, `title`, `tag`, and `score` of each post, sorted by score in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.\n",
    "Write a two-line query:\n",
    "- The first line returns a table with:\n",
    "  - Total number of posts for which the tag contains \"javascript\"\n",
    "  - Number of posts with at least one answer\n",
    "  - Average number of answers\n",
    "  - Number of views\n",
    "  - Average score of all posts with the tag \"javascript\"\n",
    "- The second line does the same for posts related to Java, not JavaScript. In this case, the tag contains the string \"java\" but not \"javascript\". The description should be \"java\". Provide meaningful names for the returned fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.\n",
    "Perform statistics to determine which days of the week the site is busiest. Show the number of posts uploaded on each day of the week, returning a row for each day in the returned table. Which day has the maximum/minimum number of posts? Is there a difference in the quality of posts between different days?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.\n",
    "Now, find all questions related to both JavaScript and Python, along with their answers. Write a query that retrieves all questions containing the word \"javascript\" in the title and \"python\" in the title, along with their corresponding answers. Each row in the returned table represents a pair of (question + answer). If a question has multiple answers, it should appear in multiple rows in the returned table. Return the `id`, `title`, `tag`, and `body` of both the question and answer, along with the creation date. Remove all newline characters from the `body` field to prevent issues in further work with the file. Save this table to a file named `stackoverflow_javascript_python_qa.csv`. Display the first few rows sorted by the question's ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.\n",
    "Suppose a US-based company wants to query all users with the highest reputation in each location across the United States. Write a query that returns the user with the highest reputation for each location (city) in the US, who are experts in JavaScript. Exclude cities where there are no such users. Return the fields: `about_me`, `website_url`, `reputation`, `display_name`, `location`. Sort by reputation in descending order and display the top results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.\n",
    "Finally, examine if there's a relationship between the number of questions/answers per user and their reputation. Group all users into categories based on the number of questions multiplied by 1000 (i.e., between 0-999, 1000-1999, etc.) and calculate the average reputation for each such category. Is there a relationship between the number of questions/answers and reputation?"

    "Looking at the output data, it's apparent that the number of questions is positively correlated with the average reputation. In other words, as the number of questions increases, so does the average reputation. However, the same phenomenon isn't observed regarding the number of answers. In the output for answers, we see that from the first interval (0-999) to the 12,000-12,999 interval, the average reputation increases, indicating a positive correlation. However, from that interval onward, the average reputation fluctuates in both directions, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing with the number of answers per interval."
